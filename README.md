# HdM_SD1_ProjectBox
Example suite of Projects that I've planned to build with first term students of the Stuttgart Media University.

The Java Project in this repository is supposed to teach the students several basic concepts of programming based on a skill-timeline in the first semester of their studies.

##### The flow of the project is supposed to be like this:

1. Basic Scanner project that simply reads in two numbers from the user, assigning them to `int` variables and prints the bigger one (**Variables, usage of Scanner and basic operands**)

1. Print every n-th number from 1 to 100. (**Scanner, For-loops, Modulo**)

1. Guess the number, using a Scanner to read user input which is then compared to the random number generated at the start of the program. (**While/For loops, Random numbers**)

1. Using Switch-Case to start a given user decided program. (**Switch-Case, Refactoring**)

1. Apply mathematical operation to Array of given size and read in values. (**Arrays, Loops, Mathematical operations**)

1. Refactoring what we've built using functions for the different programs and mathematical operations. (**Functions, Refactoring, Parameters, Arguments**)

1. Nested loops to build a christmas tree printed in the console of a given size. First thought through on paper and then implemented. (**Nested Loops, Problem solving**)

1. ... TODO
